    MIME [Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension]
            - is an Internet standard that extends the format of email messages to support 
              text in character sets other than ASCII, as well attachments of audio, video, 
              images, and application programs. Message bodies may consist of multiple parts, 
              and header information may be specified in non-ASCII character sets. Email messages 
              with MIME formatting are typically transmitted with standard protocols, such as the Simple 
              Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), the Post Office Protocol (POP), and the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP).

    MIME headers
        - MIME-Version
            The presence of this header field indicates the message is MIME-formatted. The value is typically "1.0". The field appears as follows:
                MIME-Version: 1.0
        - Content-Type
            This header field indicates the media type of the message content, consisting of a type and subtype, for example
                Content-Type: text/plain
        - Content-Disposition
            The original MIME specifications only described the structure of mail messages. They did not address the issue of presentation styles.
                Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=genome.jpeg;

    SMTP [Simple Mail Transfer Protocol]
        Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is the standard protocol for email services on a TCP/IP network. 
        SMTP provides the ability to send and receive email messages.

        SMTP is an application-layer protocol that enables the transmission and delivery of email over the Internet. 
        SMTP is created and maintained by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).

        Simple Mail Transfer Protocol is also known as RFC 821 and RFC 2821.
