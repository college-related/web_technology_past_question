CSS selector are the patterns used to select the element you want to style.

    some example
        .cn - select element with classname cn
        #i - select element with id i
        div - select all the div
        div p - select all p inside div
        div+p - select p that is right next to div
        div>p - select all p that is direct child of div
        .cn, h1 - select element with classname cn and h1 tags


CSS levels of style sheet

    -internal level
        By using the <style> </style> tag we can use the features
        of css internally inside a html file itself. It is usually
        written at the top of the html file before <body> tag.

    -external level
        By using <link> tag to link a external css file inside a 
        HTML file we can use css features eternally. It is used inside the 
        <head> tag usually.
        The advantage of external over internal is
            1, we can use the external file in many different HTML files
            2, Its less flooded as the html and css files are seperate so easy to maintain

    -inline level
        By using style="" attribute inside any tag in html we 
        can use the css features inside html files. It is usually
        within a line so it is called inline level.

            exmple: <div style="border: 1px; height: 300px;"> Hello </div>
