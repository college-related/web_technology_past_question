    Domain
        - It is a alternate name for ip address that is used to 
          search the linked website with the domain name for easy
          access.
          It is done through DNS registration websites.
            --DNS(Domain Name System) 
                The process of DNS resolution involves converting a hostname (such as www.example.com) 
                into a computer-friendly IP address (such as 192.168.1.1). An IP address is given to each
                device on the Internet, and that address is necessary to find the appropriate Internet device -
                like a street address is used to find a particular home. When a user wants to load a webpage, 
                a translation must occur between what a user types into their web browser (example.com) and 
                the machine-friendly address necessary to locate the example.com webpage.
            --DNS registration websites
                are those website which have the authority to 
                provide webdeveloper with domain and respective IP address.

    WebHosting
        - Web hosting is a service that allows organizations and individuals to post a website or web page 
          onto the Internet. A web host, or web hosting service provider, is a business that provides the 
          technologies and services needed for the website or webpage to be viewed in the Internet. Websites 
          are hosted, or stored, on special computers called servers. When Internet users want to view your website, 
          all they need to do is type your website address or domain into their browser. Their computer will then 
          connect to your server and your webpages will be delivered to them through the browser.
