Q, JS is called a client side scripting language why?

------ Because all the processing or the rendering of js codes
       is done inside the clients computer through the web browser
       no need for server connection.

------ JavaScript is a client-side scripting language, which means 
       the source code is processed by the client's web browser rather 
       than on the web server. This means JavaScript functions can run 
       after a webpage has loaded without communicating with the server. 
       For example, a JavaScript function may check a web form before it is 
       submitted to make sure all the required fields have been filled out. 
       The JavaScript code can produce an error message before any 
       information is actually transmitted to the server.


Q, DOM ?

------ DOM(document object model) is language used to model the
       HTML and XML elements as object and manipulating them for
       changing its color, size, etc. Js is the most used for DOM
       in web development.
       Js have some features to use the DOM from HTML and XML like
       document.getElementByid(), etc for manipulation of element 
       with certain id in the doc file.


Q, Can js be used as server side scripting language?

------ JS can be used as a server-side language if we use different programs
       like node.js, rhino, etc. It is just like normal client side JS
       except the functionallity maybe have different APIs() and it allows us
       to manipulate the server with out using PHP or java.
